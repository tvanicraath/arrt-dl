# arrt-dl
[unstable] Use yt-dlp to download media from Arrs


# Use

## Configure docker-compose file

- Get TMDB api key by following [these guidelines](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
- If using youtube searcher, get Youtube api key from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Add these keys and path to yout `data` directory to docker-compose file

```yaml
---
version: "3.1"
services:
  arrt-dl:
    image: tvanicraath/arrt-dl
    container_name: arrt-dl
    environment:
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO

      - TMDB_API_KEY={your key}
      - YOUTUBE_API_KEY={your key}

      - FLASK_PORT=5000
      - ARIA2_HOST=http://localhost #Once yt-dlp adds support for aria2 using RPC, will allow external aria2 client
      - RPC_PORT=6800
      - RPC_SECRET=80tiny39goodyogurt #Or set your own secret
      - DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/data/torrents/aria2

    volumes:
      - {path to data in your host}:/data     #path to data. aria2 will place downloads in /data/torrents/aria2/

    ports:  #some of these ports are hard coded. do not change for now.
      - 5000:5000 #flask api
      - 6800:6800 #aria2c rpc
      - 6888:6888 #aria2c transfers
      - 6888:6888/udp
    restart: unless-stopped



  AriaNg:
    container_name: ariang
    image: p3terx/ariang
    ports:
     - 6884:6880
    restart: unless-stopped

```

The `ariang` container is not necessary, it just provides a web-ui for monitoring aria2.

## Configure Radarr
- Ensure that ports `5000` and `6800` are exposed in docker-compose file
- Ensure that Radarr can now talk to `arrt-dl` at host `host.docker.internal`
- Add the download client `aria2` in Radarr at `host.docker.internal:6800`
- [Optional] Add `Publicdomainmoviedotnet` indexer in Radarr at `host.docker.internal:5000/searcher/Publicdomainmoviedotnet`. Use `API Path:/api/v1`
- [Optional] Add `Youtube` indexer in Radarr at `host.docker.internal:5000/searcher/Youtube`. Use `API Path:/api/v1`
- For all these indexers, set the above aria2 instance as the preferred download client 
- You should now be able to search movies as usual, and be able to download movies from [Publicdomainmoviedotnet](https://www.publicdomainmovie.net) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) if Radarr decides that's the best option
- Note: you might need to manually select the movie file if Radarr can't parse its name from its title

## Write Your Own Searcher
- For site `xyz`, create a file `xyz.py` in `app/indexers`
- Create a subclass `Xyz` of `Movie-Fetcher` in it and implement the `parse` function
- Add this class in `searchers.py`
- Add this new indexer to Radarr using the above steps

# Goal
Create a bridge between the [Arrs](https://wiki.servarr.com/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), starting with [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr).
This is a work in progress and the goal is to be able to simulate the following exchange.

`User ðŸ‘¶`: I want to download `Movie M`

`Radarr ðŸ“¡`: Hmmm, I found the details on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Let me ask my indexers if they can locate it. [Sends `Movie M` to all indexers]

`arrt-dl-site-A-indexer ðŸ¤–`: Hey, I found  `Movie M` on `Site A`. Unfortunately, you only deal with usenets and torrents ðŸ˜’. So I am creating a fictitious torrent file for it containing download instructions that my friend `arrt-dl-client ðŸšš` understands.

`Radarr ðŸ“¡`: Out of all responses received, `arrt-dl-site-A-indexer ðŸ¤–`'s response looks the best! [Sends the torrent to `arrt-dl-client ðŸšš`]

`arrt-dl-client ðŸšš`: Sure thing! [Downloads `Movie M` from `Site A`] Yayy, success!

`User ðŸ‘¶`:  Good bot!



# Why?
Gone are the days when each release of new Linux distro stressed the servers/mirrors and crashed them.
Back then, torrents helped prevent choking of such new releases by ensuring that content availability scales in proportion to the demand.
Modern networks have come a long way and CDNs allow for safer, quicker, and often more reliable sharing of information.
There are for example, many websites that distribute obscure copyright free movies that could be hard to locate on P2P networks.
This is especially true for people who do not want to associate with trackers sharing pirated content and 'beginners' who do not have access to private trackers.
It then makes sense to allow traditional HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP protocols for Arr services.
I believe the Arrs do not have any plans for supporting non-torrent and non-usenet sources in foreseeable future.
Hence this [Bodge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U) to make arrt-dl talk to centralized internet.
